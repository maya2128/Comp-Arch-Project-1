# Comp-Arch-Project-1
Fall 2023 Greg LaKomski  Team 7

Description: In this project you will create a simplified ARM v8 disassembler. Your
disassembler will read in a binary file containing an ARM program in machine code
and output the assembly code that generated the machine code. The instructions
will follow simplifications outlined in Zybook chapter X. You will use this code in
project 2 do a good job and test it completely. I will test your code completely and
make sure nothing has been missed and edge cases have been accounted for!
This program is not exceptionally complicated and I will provide you a pseudocode
outline and several specific things I want do in a certain way so that you practice
several skills. Please follow my instructions and do not do your own thing or you
grade will be harshly affected. I am the customer and what I want is what you will
create.

Change Notices: As in real life I reserve the right to add to this project whatever
and whenever I want to. In real life you would charge more but this is only a partial
simulation:) Point is, you should build your code to make it easy to add additional
instructions if needed!

Implementation: You MUST implement this project in Go.

Instruction Set: The instruction set your disassembler must deal with are
contained in the following table:
